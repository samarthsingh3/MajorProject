**Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction**
The aim is to investigate machine learning based techniques for CKD forecasting by prediction results in best accuracy.
The analysis of dataset by supervised machine learning technique(SMLT) to capture several informationâ€™s like, variable
identification, uni-variate analysis, bi-variate and multi-variate analysis, missing value treatments and analyze the data
validation, data cleaning/preparing and data visualization will be done on the entire given dataset.


**Installation Instructions:**
 Install Anaconda x64
 Run Jupytr notebook
 Download and open folder CODING from repository
 Open M1,M2,M3,M4,M5 .ipynb files for coding
 Open df.csv file for dataset

**Usage:**
To use the Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction project effectively, follow these steps and considerations:

1. **Data Pre-processing:**
   - Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and contains necessary columns like age, blood pressure, specific gravity, etc.
   - Use Python with Pandas and NumPy to clean the data (handling missing values, duplicates), encode categorical variables (like age categories), and split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key medical metrics from your dataset. Examples include bar plots for categorical data (e.g., gender distribution), pie charts for proportion comparisons (e.g., disease prevalence), and heatmaps for correlation analysis (e.g., relationship between variables).

3. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - Implement various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors using Scikit-learn.
   - Configure each model with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters to optimize performance for Chronic Kidney Disease prediction.

4. **Evaluation and Prediction:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Compare results across different algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
   - Implement the chosen model (Random Forest) to predict Chronic Kidney Disease based on input data. This can be done interactively or through a command-line interface.

5. **Configuration and Settings:**
   - Ensure all dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are installed in your Python environment.
   - Customize model parameters based on dataset characteristics and performance requirements (e.g., adjusting tree depth in Decision Trees or number of estimators in Random Forest).

By following these steps, users can effectively utilize the Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction project application.
