# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to investigate machine learning-based techniques for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction, aiming to achieve the highest accuracy. The analysis of the dataset using supervised machine learning techniques (SMLT) involves variable identification, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, missing value treatments, data validation, data cleaning/preparation, and data visualization.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Anaconda (x64).
2. Run Jupyter Notebook.
3. Download and open the folder "CODING" from the repository.
4. Open `M1.ipynb`, `M2.ipynb`, `M3.ipynb`, `M4.ipynb`, and `M5.ipynb` files for coding.
5. Open `df.csv` file for the dataset.

## Usage

To use the Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction project effectively, follow these steps:

### 1. Data Pre-processing
- Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and contains necessary columns like age, blood pressure, specific gravity, etc.
- Use Python with Pandas and NumPy to clean the data (handling missing values, duplicates), encode categorical variables (like age categories), and split data into training and testing sets.

### 2. Visualization
- Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key medical metrics from your dataset. Examples include:
  - Bar plots for categorical data (e.g., gender distribution).
  - Pie charts for proportion comparisons (e.g., disease prevalence).
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis (e.g., relationship between variables).

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development
- Implement various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors using Scikit-learn.
- Configure each model with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters to optimize performance for CKD prediction.

### 4. Evaluation and Prediction
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Compare results across different algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
- Implement the chosen model (Random Forest) to predict CKD based on input data. This can be done interactively or through a command-line interface.

### 5. Configuration and Settings
- Ensure all dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are installed in your Python environment.
- Customize model parameters based on dataset characteristics and performance requirements (e.g., adjusting tree depth in Decision Trees or number of estimators in Random Forest).

By following these steps, users can effectively utilize the Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction project application.
